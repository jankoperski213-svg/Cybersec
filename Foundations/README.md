## Linux Basics 🐧
### System Navigation
- `pwd` → Show current directory
- `ls` → List files
- `cd` → Change directory
- `tree` → View directory structure

### File Operations
- `touch file.txt` → Create file
- `cp file.txt copy.txt` → Copy file
- `mv file.txt new.txt` → Move/rename file
- `rm file.txt` → Remove file

### Permissions
- `ls -l` → Check permissions
- `chmod 755 file.sh` → Change permissions
- `chown user file.txt` → Change owner

## Git & GitHub Basics 💻
### Basic Commands
- `git init` → Initialize repository
- `git status` → Check changes
- `git add .` → Add all changes
- `git commit -m "description"` → Commit changes
- `git push origin main` → Push changes to GitHub

### Workflow
1. Make changes locally
2. Commit
3. Push to GitHub
4. Keep README.md as documentation

## Introduction to Cybersecurity 🛡️
### Core Concepts
- CIA Triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
- Threats: Insider threats, Human error
- Attacks: Malware, Phishing, Ransomware, DDoS

### Security Appliances
- Firewalls: Network, Transport, Application, Context-aware
- Proxy Servers: Web content filtering, Reverse proxy
- NAT Firewall: Hides private addresses
- Routers: Basic traffic filtering
- IPS: Block malicious traffic using signatures
- VPNs: Secure encrypted tunnels
- Antimalware/Antivirus: Signature & behavior-based protection
- Other devices: Web/email security, decryption, client access control, servers, management systems

### Penetration Testing Steps
1. Footprinting: Gather network info
2. Scanning: Identify exploitable weaknesses
3. Gaining Access: Exploit vulnerabilities
4. Maintaining Access: Simulate persistent intrusion
5. Reporting Findings: Suggest improvements
