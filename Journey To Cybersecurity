# Journey To Cybersecurity
## Documenting my first steps into Cybersecurity

### About Me
I am an aspiring Cybersecurity professional following a structured 12-month learning roadmap.  
My focus is on **hands-on skills**, continuous learning, and practical projects.  
I am motivated by curiosity for how systems work and a drive to help secure digital environments.  
Goal: land my first Cybersecurity role within a year.

### First Month of Learning
I began with the **Introduction to Cybersecurity (Cisco Networking Academy)**.  
Notes are available in the branch: *Introduction-To-Cybersec*.

## Key Takeaways – Expanded

- **Definition of Cybersecurity**  
  I learned that cybersecurity is not only about firewalls and antivirus software, but about protecting data, systems, and people. It’s a broad discipline covering prevention, detection, and response. For me, the biggest shift was realizing that cybersecurity is about trust – making sure users, organizations, and systems can rely on the technology they use.  

- **Common Threats**  
  The course explained threats like malware, phishing, and ransomware. What struck me most was how effective simple phishing campaigns can be compared to highly technical exploits. It made me realize that the human factor is often the weakest link, and defending systems means also educating people.  

- **Basic Security Principles (CIA Triad)**  
  I understood the importance of confidentiality, integrity, and availability as the foundation of every security decision. For example, patching a system too quickly without testing can hurt availability, while delaying patches can hurt confidentiality and integrity. I learned that security is always a balance.  

- **Network Fundamentals**  
  I grasped the basics of how data moves between devices, what protocols are involved, and how traffic can be analyzed. This helped me see why network visibility and monitoring are so critical for detecting attacks early. It also motivated me to strengthen my networking fundamentals to support deeper cybersecurity skills.  

- **Career Insights**  
  The course gave me an overview of roles in cybersecurity, from SOC Analyst to Penetration Tester. I realized that both defense (Blue Team) and offense (Red Team) have value – and my path may combine both. This motivated me to continue with a structured 3-year roadmap and build skills step by step.  
## Long-Term Roadmap  
I am following a structured 3-year roadmap (Team Purple Path), divided into:  
- **Year 1 – Blue Foundation**: Linux, Networking, Cybersecurity basics, Security+ prep  
- **Year 2 – Blue → Purple Transition**: SOC skills, SIEM tools, scripting, first SOC role  
- **Year 3 – Purple Specialization**: Threat hunting, incident response, red/purple team labs

### Skills in Progress
- Linux basics (NDG Linux 1)  
- Networking fundamentals (Cisco)  
- Git & GitHub workflow  
- Cybersecurity foundations  

### Next Steps
- Continue NDG Linux 1  
- Start Google Cybersecurity course (Coursera)  
- Document projects & labs in dedicated repos  
- Prepare for CompTIA Security+
